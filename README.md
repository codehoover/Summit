## Coding challenge

## Tech stack: 
- Nextjs
- Typescript
- Tailwind instead of styled components
- Shadcn/ui
- Radix icons

## Setup and running

- Run command npm install or yarn install ( I used node package manager for this project) 

- Run command npm run dev or yarn dev

- Development server should be running at http://localhost:3000 

This is exemplifying my ability to consume an API and transform the data into someting readable.
